        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the Summer we would go to Lake Latonka. <span class="sentence">Some of my best memories are up at the lake.</span></p>

        <p>I spent most of my childhood outdoors playing with friends and playing sports in the backyard. We would ride bikes, and play lacrosse. I had a great childhood.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching sports. I also love getting outdoors and working out. I love the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Yankees. </p>

        <p>I now work at PNC as a Operations Secialist. I want to get out of the finance field and break into tech with a Software Development degree. I am looking forward to this class and future classses to continue learning and delvelope my skills to becoming a developer.</p>
